### Running on iOS

Mac OS and Xcode are required.

- Open `ios/App.xcodeproj` to open the project in Xcode

See [Running on device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html) in the React Native Docs if you want to test on a physical device. This will involve (1) changing the JavaScript code location IP address in the AppDelegate.m file and (2) choosing a different target device in XCode.
